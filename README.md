## Abstract
Empowering visual algorithms/models quickly adapt to new environments/tasks is a key research direction in computer vision and machine learning. In the adaptation process, the matching degree between the geometry of space and the geometric structure of data plays an important role. Real-world data exhibits various froms of non-Euclidean geometric structures, such as hierarchical structures in natural language and cyclical structures in facial images. Previous research has shown that the non-Euclidean structure of real-world data are consistent with Riemannian manifold structures, providing theoretical feasibility for modeling data using Riemannian manifolds. Here, we study to create suitable Riemannian geometry of the underlying data space to match the given data from the data-level, model-level, and optimizer-level perspectives
